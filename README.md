# Ultrasound_MagnetXplorers
This is the dedicated space to find the Arduino codes for the ultrasound probe experiment of MagnetXplorers. The code is largely inspired by codes that you can find online as documentation associated with the HC-SR04.

In order to install the code on the ultrasound probe:
1. Download Arduino IDE from the official website to a computer.
2. Install Arduino IDE on the computer.
3. Open Arduino IDE.
4. Connect your Arduino board and configure the correct Arduino port corresponding to your board.
5. Download the Arduino_code_MagnetXplorer in the language of your choice from this Github repository.
6. Open it using Arduino IDE and upload the code onto the Arduino board.
7. Open the serial monitor and read the measurement values.

The code we created is designed to work using an Arduino board connected to an HC-SR04 ultrasound emitter.
